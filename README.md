# Steganography Generator: Text â†’ Bitmap


### Overview
This program takes text input from the user, converts it into a series of six-digit hex color codes, converts each hex value into a 24-bit sRGB color, and outputs a bitmap image.


### Notes / Usage
* Make sure input is plain text
* Conversions include space and newline characters
* Longer text produces larger images (more characters = more pixels = bigger dimensions)
* Excessively large inputs, such as entire books or long documents, can be processed (within reason), though it takes a few extra seconds to generate larger bitmaps
* The output image gets saved to the cmake-build-debug directory
